            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>dinnertable: A 20-Seat Speakeasy-Style Restaurant</h1><p>The sign beside the interior door reads "Press for Food." If you're in front of it, you've just walked through the bustling East Village cocktail bar The Garret East, beyond a curtain, into a petite corridor. A push of the analog button sends a chime to the inside and you're promptly greeted.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/682b41fef064cf8db469586081efdcf85b09289c.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>So Now We Know How C-3PO Got His Red Arm In The Force Awakens</h1><p>Ladies and gentlemen, our global nightmare is over. After months-nearly five of them in fact-of waiting, Marvel's one-shot comic, revealing just why C-3PO has a red arm for most of The Force Awakens, is finally here. As bizarre as it may sound at first, the final product isn't half bad.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ff7a99fdf22b973fd7d5ffe88bda91f4fec8e32d.png"></article>]]></description>
